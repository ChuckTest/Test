An asynchronous operation that uses the IAsyncResult design pattern is implemented as two methods named BeginOperationName and EndOperationName that begin and end the asynchronous operation OperationName respectively. 
For example, the FileStream class provides the BeginRead and EndRead methods to asynchronously read bytes from a file. These methods implement the asynchronous version of the Read method.
After calling BeginOperationName, an application can continue executing instructions on the calling thread while the asynchronous operation takes place on a different thread. 
For each call to BeginOperationName, the application should also call EndOperationName to get the results of the operation.
